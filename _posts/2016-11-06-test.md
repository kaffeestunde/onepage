title:  "Speculating possible futures of smart and connected communities through design fiction"

Designers don’t only consider the problems and possibilities of today, but also look to the future and speculate what is to come. Moreover, they engage others in the discovery of alternative ways of being and living. 

In order to imagine a possible near future of Bloomington as a smart and connected community, we developed a set of design ideas that co-exist in a fictional world. This fictional world embraces science fact and fiction, but is ultimately grounded in the familiar. We showcase this vision of Bloomington through a tourism video, a familiar genre that grounds our design concepts, but also opens up our imaginations to seemingly impossible ideas.

In developing this design fiction, we considered that smart and connected cities are in the near future. Cities will be supported by technology that will introduce new ways of living, working, and being. How will these future interactions shape the way people experience cities? Moreover, how will the cultures entrenched in cities surface in order to draw visitors from afar in search of one-of-a-kind experiences? 

Design fictions can be valuable tools for re-imagining the status quo. However, they must be grounded in the familiar so that the connection between what is true today, and what can be true tomorrow is strong. Tourism videos serve as an effective and accessible means of circulating fictional or speculative ideas because they can work in two ways: 1) they are familiar to nearly everyone; and 2) they are effective at communicating subjective and romanticized visions of destinations, thus also providing insight into the values and points of pride held by societies and cultures.    

We first set out to understand how people of Bloomington go about their everyday lives. We wanted to dive deep into the infrastructure underpinning Bloomington. Hence, we looked for insights in unlikely places by serving as apprentices under a wide range of stakeholders from transportation, urban planning, food, and communication. Through these contextual inquiries, we were able to gain a richer understanding of both the visible and invisible infrastructures that shape people’s lives in Bloomington. Moreover, we uncovered opportunities for speculation across similar ways of being, and used those opportunities to ground our design fiction. 

I conducted a contextual interview with a Bloomington Transit bus driver and drove with him for about 2 hours.

As a team, we pulled together our findings and created an affinity diagram to make sense of our data following Beyer, H. & Holtzblatt, K. (1998).

As a team we discovered similar ways of being across our contextual inquiries. Mainly, we categorized our findings into common mental models, tools, terminology, goals and values, methods, and support systems.
