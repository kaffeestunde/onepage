_**Speculating possible futures of smart and connected communities through design fiction**_

Designers don’t only consider the problems and possibilities of today, but also look to the future and speculate what is to come. Moreover, they engage others in the discovery of alternative ways of being and living. 

In order to imagine a possible near future of Bloomington as a smart and connected community, we developed a set of design ideas that co-exist in a fictional world. This fictional world embraces science fact and fiction, but is ultimately grounded in the familiar. We showcase this vision of Bloomington through a tourism video, a familiar genre that grounds our design concepts, but also opens up our imaginations to seemingly impossible ideas.

In developing this design fiction, we considered that smart and connected cities are in the near future. Cities will be supported by technology that will introduce new ways of living, working, and being. How will these future interactions shape the way people experience cities? Moreover, how will the cultures entrenched in cities surface in order to draw visitors from afar in search of one-of-a-kind experiences? 

Design fictions can be valuable tools for re-imagining the status quo. However, they must be grounded in the familiar so that the connection between what is true today, and what can be true tomorrow is strong. Tourism videos serve as an effective and accessible means of circulating fictional or speculative ideas because they can work in two ways: 1) they are familiar to nearly everyone; and 2) they are effective at communicating subjective and romanticized visions of destinations, thus also providing insight into the values and points of pride held by societies and cultures.    

<br />

_**Conducting field work to inform design**_ 

We first set out to understand how people of Bloomington go about their everyday lives. We wanted to dive deep into the infrastructure underpinning Bloomington. Hence, we looked for insights in unlikely places by serving as apprentices under a wide range of stakeholders from transportation, urban planning, food, and communication. Through these contextual inquiries, we were able to gain a richer understanding of both the visible and invisible infrastructures that shape people’s lives in Bloomington. Moreover, we uncovered opportunities for speculation across similar ways of being, and used those opportunities to ground our design fiction. 

I conducted a contextual interview with a Bloomington Transit bus driver, and drove with him for 
about 2 hours through campus, as well as downtown Bloomington. Bus drivers provide transportation for many students going between their apartments and campus. As many as 30 students boarded the bus in particular busy spots on campus, and the bus driver couldn’t feasible check everyone’s IDs properly. Instead, he relied on his memory. Moreover, most students carry student IDs which grant them free access to the bus, but these IDs must still be checked because people do counterfeit them.

What if bus drivers didn’t have to check IDs, and could just look at people’s faces to know if the person has a pass or not? Could face scanning for access be used in other places that require passes, special IDs, or tickets?  

I found that bus drivers also heavily rely on their radio for communication. The bus driver I rode with was really social and friendly and liked to chat and make friends with passengers. He even informed another bus driver that I would be boarding his bus and to welcome me because I was conducting research. How will bus driver’s social culture change in the future? How could it be further supported with technology?

To understand more about Tourism in Bloomington, we followed up with a visit to the Bloomington Visitor’s center. Employees there helped us understand the importance of making tourism accessible to everyone, especially those who move around in wheelchairs. One employee expressed the need for more personalized information about particular buildings or sites in Bloomington stating that there is a lot of history, but few ways of expressing it to visitors. Lastly, they expressed the importance of Midwestern hospitality in making them feel good as tourists. The employee said he likes to feel included and welcomed.

_**Making sense of data using affinity diagramming**_ 

Affinity diagramming is a data analysis technique developed by Beyer & Holtzblatt as part of contextual design. As a team, we pulled together our findings from the field research we conducted and created an affinity diagram to make sense of our data. First, we wrote down our findings on different colored post-it notes. Then we categorized them into several overarching categories: mental models, tools, terminology, goals and values, methods, and support systems. We vetted through the categories to further break down each category into subcategories of about 4–5 post-its. Using these subcategories, we developed 20 design concepts. 

Creating an affinity diagram helped us bring together disparate findings from across a wide range of topics. It also helped us see across those topics, and abstract common themes and ways of being, which helped to ground our design concepts.

We learned the following: 

*	(1) People around the city aren’t tech savvy. It is difficult to “deal” with technology while performing everyday work duties. 

*	(2) Many decisions on the job are made by communicating with people face to face. 

*	(3) Human to human interaction is valuable and in certain situations people just prefer a human response. 

*	(4) People ask questions when they need help before attempting to look up information. 
	
*	(5) Information about the city isn’t transparent. People don’t know services exist, or they don’t know where to find information about them. 
*	(6) Almost all services are transactional where some form of physical artifact is used for payment, or for gaining access. 

*	(7) City workers rely on calendars and maps to keep track of time and place.

*	(8) People want to feel welcome when they come to a new place. 


<br />
We translated these insights into a set of concepts:

_**Framing our design concepts in scenarios**_

In order to communicate our concepts using the tourism video, we brainstormed several scenarios of tourists coming to Bloomington in search of a craft or nature adventure. Based on our research, we found that nature seems to be a big attraction of Bloomington because of proximity to lakes and parks such as Griffy Lake. Moreover, downtown Bloomington has many shops selling handmade or antique goods drawing in visitors who desire one-of-a-kind goods. We wanted to leverage these existing strengths of Bloomington and decided to imagine the future of tourism in Bloomington as a nature to craft adventure. Visitors can first explore parks and collect materials, and then bring them to craft centers to engaging making and crafting with local artisans. They can also learn about local craft and purchase Bloomington made artifacts. 

<br />

_**Video production**_ 

We set out to various locations to film our tourism video. Mainly, we visited Griffy Lake in Bloomington and noted all of the birdhouses in the trees, which we thought would make good crafts. We also took footage at the Visitor’s center in order to film the welcome party. Lastly, we visited the Ivy Tech Community College Arts building in downtown Bloomington in order to film the craft adventure in the ceramics studio.  

In terms of cinematography, we decided to use photos to create a stop motion effect. This way all team members could be involved in video editing at the same time.
