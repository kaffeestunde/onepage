title:  "Speculating possible futures of smart and connected communities through design fiction"

Designers donâ€™t only consider the problems and possibilities of today, but also look to the future and speculate what is to come. Moreover, they engage others in the discovery of alternative ways of being and living. In order to imagine a possible near future of Bloomington as a smart and connected community, we developed a set of design ideas that co-exist in a fictional world. This fictional world embraces science fact and fiction, but is ultimately grounded in the familiar. We showcase this vision of Bloomington through a tourism video, a familiar genre that grounds our design concepts, but also opens up our imaginations to seemingly impossible ideas.
